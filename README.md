Customization

Adding or Modifying Habits

To customize the habits being tracked:

	1.	Open src/components/MonthView.js.
	2.	Modify the habitsList array:

const habitsList = ['Reading', 'Exercise', 'Study', 'Meditation', 'Sleep'];


	3.	Save the file. The new habits will now appear in the Month View.

Changing Color Schemes

You can adjust the color scheme by modifying the CSS files located in src/components/.

For example, to change the colors of the day cells:

	â€¢	Open YearView.css.
	â€¢	Modify the getColorForDay function in YearView.js to return your desired colors.

Troubleshooting

	â€¢	Heatmap Misalignment: If the heatmap appears misaligned, ensure that your browser zoom level is set to 100% and that youâ€™re using a modern browser.
	â€¢	Data Not Saving: If your habit data isnâ€™t saving between sessions, check that your browser allows localStorage.

Future Enhancements

	â€¢	User Authentication: Implement user accounts to allow syncing data across devices.
	â€¢	Custom Habit Creation: Allow users to add and manage their own habits dynamically.
	â€¢	Statistics Dashboard: Provide visual charts and statistics for habit tracking over time.
	â€¢	Export/Import Data: Enable users to export their data to CSV or import existing data.
